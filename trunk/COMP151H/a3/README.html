<h3>Your assignment</h3>

<p>In this third piece of your programming project, you are assigned to
maintain and extend the expression evaluator code built in <a
href="http://www.cs.ust.hk/~dekai/151H/assignments/a2/html/">Assignment 2</a>.
Your job this time is to take the following steps.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Handle errors using exceptions</h3>

<p>The first step is to fix your program so that whenever it encounters an
error condition, it follows more solid software engineering practice by
throwing an exception, instead of ungracefully printing an error message and
exiting.</p>

<p>To support this, the <tt>main.cpp</tt> driver program we give you has been
modified so that the read-eval-print loop catches all
<tt>runtime_exception</tt> objects you might throw. Our exception handler
will print "ERROR: " followed by the specific message string obtained by
calling the <tt>what()</tt> member function on the 
<tt>runtime_exception</tt> object you threw (so try to supply useful,
meaningful error messages). Then, instead of clumsily exiting the program, it
will go back to the beginning of the read-eval-print loop and await another
input expression.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Support definition and use of symbols</h3>

<p>The next step is to add the capability to define symbols, i.e., symbolic
variables. (In the next step, you will add the capability to use the symbols
that have been defined.)</p>

<p>Here's how to proceed. In addition to all the operators from Assignments 1
and 2, you are to add a new <tt>define</tt> operator. This operator accepts
exactly two operands, as for example in <tt>(define x (* (+ 2 3) 6))</tt>.
The first operand must be a symbol, while the second operand can be of any
type. The return value from a <tt>define</tt> expression is <em>always</em>
nil, i.e., the empty list <tt>()</tt>, so the return value is irrelevant.
Instead, the real point is that after evaluating the expression <tt>(define x
(* (+ 2 3) 6))</tt> the symbol <tt>x</tt> will be <i>bound</i> to
<tt>30</tt>.</p>

<p>In C++, this is roughly analogous to a variable definition with an initial
value, as in <tt>int x((2 + 3) * 6)</tt>.</p>

<p>Note that symbols may <em>not</em> be redefined. So if <tt>x</tt> has
already been defined as above, then evaluating <tt>(define x 42)</tt> should
generate an error. (This is roughly analogous in C++ to saying that all
variable definitions must be constant, as in <tt>const int x((2 + 3) * 6)</tt>. Later
on, we'll explore the possibility of allowing existing variables to be
<em>rebound</em> via an assignment operator.)</p>

<p>To accomplish this, you are to implement a global <i>symbol table</i>
using the <tt>map</tt> container template you learned about in <a
href="http://course.cs.ust.hk/comp151H/labs/lab12/index.html">lab</a>. You
will use the <tt>map</tt> container to remember what values have been bound
to what symbols. The <tt>map</tt> container gives you a dictionary data
structure, so the interface is slightly more powerful than the sequence
containers we discussed in lecture. You are to instantiate the <tt>map</tt>
container using the template parameters <tt>map&lt;string, Cell*&gt;</tt>.
The string is to be used hold a symbol name, while the Cell is to be used to
hold a copy of the value that the symbol is bound to. (To learn how to use
<tt>map</tt>, consult your textbook, the lab pages, and/or the reference
pages mentioned in the lecture slides.)</p>

<p>Next, you should extend your evaluator so that if <tt>eval()</tt> is
called on a previously defined symbol, then it will return the value that the
symbol has been bound to. So assuming <tt>x</tt> has been defined as in the
foregoing example, then later on, evaluating the expression <tt>(- 100
x)</tt> should return the value <tt>70</tt>.</p>

<p>Note that in this step, we are changing the specification of what it means
to evaluate a symbol! Unlike in Assignments 1 and 2, evaluating a symbol
<tt>foo</tt> no longer simply returns <tt>foo</tt>. Instead, you need to look
up the symbol name <tt>foo</tt> in the symbol table, and return the value
bound to that symbol name.</p>

<p>Here's an extended example session with a correct implementation:</p>

<p><tt>% main<br />
&gt; (define a 3)<br />
()<br />
&gt; a<br />
3<br />
&gt; (define asquared (* a a))<br />
()<br />
&gt; asquared<br />
9<br />
&gt; (define b 4.0)<br />
()<br />
&gt; b<br />
4.0<br />
&gt; (define csquared (+ asquared (* b b)))<br />
()<br />
&gt; csquared<br />
25.0<br />
&gt; (+ csquared 1)<br />
26.0<br />
&gt; csquared<br />
25.0<br />
&gt; (define foo (quote hello))<br />
()<br />
&gt; foo<br />
hello<br />
&gt; bar<br />
ERROR: attempt to reference an undefined symbol "bar"<br />
&gt; (define baz hello)<br />
ERROR: attempt to reference an undefined symbol "hello"<br />
&gt; </tt></p>

<p>Note that evaluating a symbol that has not already been defined should
generate an error.</p>

<p>Also note that it results in undefined behavior if you try to evaluate an
expression containing both a <tt>(define x ...)</tt> and also some use of the
value of <tt>x</tt>. For example, <tt>(+ x (define x 4))</tt> does not result
in well-defined behavior. This is because <tt>eval()</tt> does not guarantee
what order the operands are evaluated, so we cannot predict what value (if
any) <tt>x</tt> will have at the time it is evaluated.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Support boolean expressions</h3>

<p>Add boolean expressions using the less than <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>not</tt>
operators, both of which return either 0 or 1 int values, representing false
and true respectively.</p>

<p>The <tt>&lt;</tt> operator accepts zero or more operands, each of which
can be either int or double, returning 0 if any two consecutive operands are
not monotonically increasing, and 1 otherwise.</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (&lt; 3 4)<br />
1<br />
&gt; (&lt; 4.2 3)<br />
0<br />
&gt; (&lt; 3 3.0)<br />
0<br />
&gt; (&lt;)<br />
1<br />
&gt; (&lt; 3)<br />
1<br />
&gt; (&lt; 3 4 6 8 9)<br />
1<br />
&gt; (&lt; 3 6 4 8 9)<br />
0<br />
</tt></p>

<p>The <tt>not</tt> operator accepts exactly one operand, returning 1 if the
operand is zero (either int or double), and 0 otherwise.</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (not 0)<br />
1<br />
&gt; (not (- 3.2 3.2))<br />
1<br />
&gt; (not 1)<br />
0<br />
&gt; (not 4.2)<br />
0<br />
&gt; (not (&lt; 7 8))<br />
0<br />
</tt></p>

<p>Your boolean expressions will be especially useful in conjunction with
your existing <tt>if</tt> operator which, recall, evaluates the first
argument, and then evalutes and returns the second argument if the first
argument evaluated to a non-zero value, otherwise evaluating and returning
the third argument (remember that this <strong>short-circuit</strong>
evaluation method is critically important):</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (if (&lt; 4 3) 66 77)<br />
77<br />
</tt></p>

<p>Recall that the behavior of <tt>if</tt> is analogous to the
<em>&lt;bool&gt;</em> <tt>?</tt> <em>&lt;then&gt;</em> <tt>:</tt>
<em>&lt;else&gt;</em> operator in C++.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Expose <tt>print</tt> and <tt>eval</tt> in Scheme</h3>

<p>Finally, you will expose your existing C++ implementation of
<tt>print</tt> and <tt>eval</tt> so that they can be called from Scheme, just
like you already did in Assignment 2 for the <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>car</tt>,
<tt>cdr</tt>, and <tt>nullp</tt> operators.</p>

<p>The <tt>print</tt> operator accepts one operand, which it evaluates,
printing the resulting value onto the <tt>cout</tt> output stream. The return
value from a <tt>print</tt> expression is <em>always</em> nil, i.e., the
empty list <tt>()</tt>.</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (print (+ 1 2))<br />
<strong>3</strong><br />
()<br />
&gt; (print (quote (+ 1 2)))<br />
<strong>(+ 1 2)</strong><br />
()<br />
</tt></p>

<p>The <tt>eval</tt> operator accepts one operand, and returns the result of
evaluating the operand:</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (cons (quote +) (quote (1 2)))<br />
(+ 1 2) <br />
&gt; (eval (cons (quote +) (quote (1 2))))<br />
3 <br />
&gt; (quote (cons (quote +) (quote (1 2))))<br />
(cons (quote +) (quote (1 2))) <br />
&gt; (eval (quote (cons (quote +) (quote (1 2)))))<br />
(+ 1 2) <br />
&gt; (eval (eval (quote (cons (quote +) (quote (1 2))))))<br />
3<br />
</tt></p>

<h3>Optional bonus: Clean up your evaluator using function templates</h3>

<p>Use function templates to eliminate the redundancy in your previous
implementation of the evaluator. You should have noticed that your previous
implementation of the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
functions looked almost identical for both <tt>IntCell</tt> and
<tt>DoubleCell</tt> operands. You probably did a lot of "reuse by copying".
This seems wasteful, ugly, bug-prone, and hard to maintain. Really you should
be able to use function templates so that you only have one copy of the code,
that can be instantiated for all the different cases.</p>

<p>Please note that you should <em>not</em> remove the polymorphism from
your Assignment 2 implementation. The use of function templates is
<em>in addition to</em> your existing virtual functions, and is just to
make your existing functions more concise.</p>

<p>After this step, <tt>parse()</tt> and any other functions that made proper
use of the interface encapsulated by <tt>cons.hpp</tt> or <tt>Cell.hpp</tt>
should all still work.</p>

<h3>Putting it all together and testing your implementation</h3>

<p>Except for the modified version of <tt>main.cpp</tt>, all other source files
in <tt>a3.tar.gz</tt> are identical to those from <tt>a2.tar.gz</tt>.</p>

<p>So you should start from your Assignment 2 implementation and extend
it, replacing only the old <tt>main.cpp</tt> with the new one. Be careful!
You still may not break any of the encapsulation rules from Assignment
2.</p>

<p>The a3.tar.gz tarball contains many development test cases to help
you with testing your implementation.  They are broken into three
categories: easy cases (<tt>testinput.dev.easy.txt</tt>), general cases
(<tt>testinput.dev.general.txt</tt>, and exception cases
(<tt>testinput.dev.exception.txt</tt>). All the correct outputs are also
given to you for both the easy cases (<tt>testinput.dev.easy.ref.txt</tt>)
and the general cases (<tt>testinput.dev.general.ref.txt</tt>).</p>

<p>Your submitted implementation will be graded using a similar (but
different) set of test cases.</p>

<p>In addition, the tarball contains the binary executable of a reference
solution (compiled for the Linux lab machines you are supposed to
be using).  You can run this program to see the possible behavior
of a correct solution.  (Note that your implementation might give
different results for some error cases, because for all operators
other than <tt>if</tt>, we have deliberately avoided specifying what
order the operands are evaluated and checked.  This could lead to
different errors being discovered first, causing evaluation to be
prematurely aborted when the exception is thrown.)</p>

<p>Remember, the objective of this programming project is for you to train
your skills, by practicing correct software engineering techniques
enabling you to build, maintain, and extend a non-trivial piece of
well-engineered code.</p>

<h3>Important reminders</h3>

<p>You must follow the design approach outlined in this document. Do
<em>not</em> just implement the required functionality using a different
design.</p>

<p>This time you <em>must</em> use templates. In this assignment, you are
expected to make good use of the STL <tt>map</tt> - but neatly, without
messing up the polymorphic approach you built in Assignment 2.</p>

<p>Remember we are focusing on proper use of encapsulation. So you still
should <em>not</em> edit the files <tt>parse.hpp</tt>, <tt>parse.cpp</tt>,
<tt>cons.hpp</tt>, <tt>eval.hpp</tt>, or <tt>main.cpp</tt>. Again, the
programming assignments are mini-exercises in how multiple programmers are
supposed to interact and communicate in the real world; these files are
<em>owned</em> and <em>maintained</em> by the other author(s).</p>

<p>You will need to turn in your own improved and extended implementation of
<tt>eval.cpp</tt>. Depending on your approach, you may or may not also wish
to add more files.</p>

<p>Depending on your approach, you may or may not need to change the
<tt>Makefile</tt>. Whether you changed it or not, always make sure you
include whatever <tt>Makefile</tt> is needed to build your program, when you
submit assignment. Otherwise, the graders cannot build your program.</p>

<p>You must write the final version of the program on your own. Sophisticated
plagiarism detection systems are in operation, and they are pretty good at
catching copying! If you worked in study groups, you must also acknowledge
your collaborators in the write-up for each problem, whether or not they are
classmates. Other cases will be dealt with as plagiarism. Re-read the policy
on the course home page, and note the University's tougher policy this year
regarding cheating.</p>

<p><strong>Your programming style (how clearly and how well you speak C++) is
what will be graded. Correct functioning of your program is necessary but not
sufficient!</strong></p>
